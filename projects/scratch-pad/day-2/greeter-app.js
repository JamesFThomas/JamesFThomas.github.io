/** 
 * IN CLASS EXERCISE: Greeter App
 *
 * Using if, else-if and else, AND depending on the hour of the day, 
 * write a greeting program that prints a greeting to the screen like so: 
 *
 * // hour is 0-11
 * Good Morning!
 *
 * // hour is 12-16
 * Good Afternoon! 
 *
 * // hour is 17-21
 * Good Evening!
 *
 * // hour is 22-24 
 * Good Night!
 *
 * TIPS: 
 * 
 *   a. At what threshold does morning become afternoon? What comparison 
 *      can be used to test that the hour is within the morning threshold. 
 *      It's best to be consistant and use the SAME type of comparison for 
 *      each threshold. 
 *   
 *   b. Does the last threshold even need an else-if?
 * 
 *   c. The tests are CASE sensitive, so you MUST console.log('Good Night!') with
 *      the exact case.

 * To test our greeter when developing, we need to fake some input data, ie,

 * 
 * In a more realistic setting, you might do something like this to get the 
 * actual system hour:
 *
 * var today = new Date();
 * var hour = today.getHours();
